# CustomScrollBar
Javascript custom scroll bar in Vanilla JS. Manipulation works by click and drag, scroll wheel and clicking on empty areas of the scroll track. Containers set with flexible sizing will auto adjust the bar location, bar size and scrolled area location. Utilizes a global event listener for click and drag events so any number of elements requiring click and drag events can be managed, anywhere, with one object handling the motion and mouseup actions for the entire app.

index.html example is ONLY setup to run via live-server (install via NPM and run "live-server" in commandline in this dir) or similar live server.
